# JavaScript Practice – 15 Problems

The goal of this program is to get you from "can code but not very much" to
"comfortable with the basic tools of algorithms in TypeScript." If you can do
all 15 problems, you should be in a good state to pass the precourse eval and
also (and more importantly) do day-to-day software work, with or without AI.

DO NOT USE AI TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS!! That's not the point! :)

## Rules & Guidelines

- **No external help** except EloquentJS book and MDN documentation. You can get more details about a problem by googling it, but _do not look up the answer_.
- **Write tests** for each solution to verify correctness  
- **Time yourself** – aim to complete each problem within reasonable limits  
- **Optimize solutions** – consider time and space complexity  
- **Document your code** – add comments explaining your approach  
- **Debug systematically** – use `console.log` and step-through debugging  
- **Make PRs** - So instructors can check your work
- **Ask for help** - if a problem is unclear (even after googling) or you're entirely stuck for more than 90 minutes, ask for help from an AI or in discord.
- **Just use the standard library** - do not use any fancy libraries, just use plain JS or TS files and use `node` or `bun` to execute your files.

## Fundamentals & Basics

1. **FizzBuzz** – print numbers 1–100, but replace multiples of 3 with "Fizz", 5 with "Buzz", and both with "FizzBuzz".  
2. **Reverse a String** – reverse a string manually without using built-in reverse methods.  
3. **Palindrome Checker** – check if a string reads the same forward and backward.  
4. **Count Vowels** – count the number of vowels in a given string.  
5. **Largest Number in Array** – find the largest number without using `Math.max()`.  
6. **Remove Duplicates from Array** – remove duplicate values while preserving order.  
7. **Factorial (Iterative)** – compute factorial using a loop.  
8. **Prime Number Checker** – determine if a number is prime.  
9. **Binary Search** – search for a target in a sorted array and return its index or -1.  
10. **Array Intersection** – return common unique values between two arrays.  
11. **Two Sum** – find two numbers in an array that add up to a target sum.  
12. **Anagram Checker** – check if two strings are anagrams of each other.  
13. **Caesar Cipher** – implement a simple shift cipher for encoding/decoding text.  
14. **Valid Email Checker** – validate a simple email format without regex.  
15. **Find Missing Number** – find the missing integer in a sequence from 1 to n.
