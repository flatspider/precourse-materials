- What is git? Why do we need it?

Git is a version control software that allows you to explicitly manage changes to code files. Programmers need it to allow themselves clear control over code changes, feature updates, collaboration, and for history and review processes. Without git, a codebase can change without keeping track of what changed or who changed it. This makes resolving bugs and "rolling back" production breaking errors much more difficult.
